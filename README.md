# Quote Of The Day

This project requires a database to back it. I use Supabase, which is free for the resources this project would consume.
A table is expected with the columns "id", "quote" and "source".

The app both creates a website (at the root directory), and an API for fetching quotes (at /api/quotes). 

Prior to deployment, copy .env.ex to .env and update credentials.
